# Prague Bioinformatics Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
members and participants pledge to making participation in our community a 
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of behaviors to be avoided include:
* Unconstructive criticism: Do not merely decry the current state of affairs. Offer suggestions as to how things may
    be improved.
* Making political posts, including expressions of political preference, which tend to turn the environment sour very quickly.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject messages, comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any community participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within community spaces, including but not limited to
the community Slack channel and events organized by the community, and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the community. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting Martin Modr√°k at martin.modrak@biomed.cas.cz, or (if possible) in person at the Institute of Microbiology. 
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Community moderators are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
